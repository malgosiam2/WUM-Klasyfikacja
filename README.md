# Astronomical Object Classification
## Goal
To evaluate different machine learning models and techniques for effectively classifying astronomical objects, while learning key concepts of data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)

This project focuses on classifying astronomical objects into **stars**, **galaxies**, and **quasars** using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of the *Introduction to Machine Learning* course.

## Project Structure

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A comprehensive analysis of the astronomical dataset, focusing on:
- Object identification methods  
- Applied filters  
- Distribution of right ascension and declination

### 2. Feature Engineering (FE)
- Selection of the most relevant features  
- Creation of new features to improve model performance

### 3. Modeling
Development and comparison of classification models. Includes hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and performance.
